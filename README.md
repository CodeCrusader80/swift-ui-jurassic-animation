<h1>Swift UI Jurassic Frame</h1> 
<br>
<p>This is a page containing a custom font as well as sprites to animate a dinosaur around certain actions such as running, jumping or simply game over. To make the experience a little easier for the user to use, there is no question of having to click several times to trigger the animation, instead the play button is connected to a timer function, which allows to start or stop the succession of sprites once the button is activated, which simplifies the maneuver in the animation of the image. This is a method that can be applied to more complex animations than this one.</p>
